## Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of MODPRO!

MODPRO is a desktop application which helps NUS students track the progress of their modules.

MODPRO helps youâ€¦
* organise your tasks by modules and exams
* track your progress for each module and exam with a progress bar
* easily navigate through your tasks by tagging your tasks, filtering and sorting your task list.

It is highly optimised for students who prefer Command Line Interface (CLI) by allowing those who type fast to key in commands to track their modules. If you struggle to type fast, we also provide a Graphical User interface (GUI) to assist you in using MODPRO.

------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start 

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `modpro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases/download/v1.3.1/modpro.jar).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for MODPRO.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds. <br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window. <br>
   Here are some commands you can try:

   * `m add c/CS2100 m/Computer Organisation mc/4` : Adds the module called Computer Organisation with the module code CS2100 into the module list.
   * `m list` : Lists all modules stored in the module list.
   * `m delete 1` : Deletes the 1st module shown in the displayed module list.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: How to read the command format:**<br>
  
* Command words are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `t add` is the same as `T add` for command words

* Prefixes are case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. `t add m/CS2030 d/Programming` is not the same as `t add M/CS2030 D/Programming` and the latter command will throw an error message

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `t add m/MODULE`, `MODULE` is a parameter which can be used as `t add m/CS2030`.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `t/KEYWORD [SECOND_KEYWORD]` can be used as `t/priority deadline` or as `t/priority`.
  
* Items in square brackets with * are optional, but at least one of them is required.<br>
  e.g `[m/MODULE]* [d/DESCRIPTION]*` can be used as `m/cs2030` or `m/cs2030 d/assignment` but not ` `(none provided).
  
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `m/MODULE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION m/MODULE` is also acceptable.
  
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command and it is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `m/cs2030 m/cs2040`, only `m/cs2040` will be taken.
  
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, exit and clearall) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
