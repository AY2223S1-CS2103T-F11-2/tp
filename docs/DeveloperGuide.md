### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort Task Command

#### How the feature works

The `sort` command allows users to sort the task list by priority status,
deadline, module code and task description with ease. The sort command operates
directly on the `ObservableList` stored under `DistinctTaskList` in `AddressBook` so the
`ObservableList` in `DistinctTaskList` will be permanently sorted to the criteria.
* When sorting by priority, all tasks with `HIGH` priority status will be positioned at the top of the 
displayed task list, followed by `MEDIUM`, `LOW` and 
lastly all tasks with no priority tags.
* When sorting by deadline, all tasks with deadline tags will be displayed 
at the top of the displayed task list with the task with the earliest deadline
being displayed at the top. All the remaining tasks with no deadline tags will
be displayed below all tasks with deadline tags.

`sort` command adheres to the following format: `sort c/CRITERIA`

`CRITERIA` can be one of the following criteria:
* `priority`
* `deadline`
* `module`
* `description`

#### Sequence of the SortTaskCommand

Shown below is a sequence diagram of what occurs when the `excute` method of
`LogicManager` is invoked.

<img src="images/SortTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

**Sequence of actions made when `execute` method of `LogicManager` is invoked**
1. `LogicManager` object takes in `"sort c/priority"` which the user keys into the command line. 
2. `LogicManager` object calls the `parseCommand` of the `AddressBookParser` object created during the initialisation 
of `LogicManager` object and passes the `"sort c/priority"` as the arguments of `parseCommand`
3. `SortTaskCommandParser` object is created during execution of `parseCommand` of `AddressBookParser`
4. `SortTaskCommandParser` object calls its `parse` method with `"c/priority"` being passed in as argument.
5. `SortTaskCommand` object called st is created from `SortTaskCommandParser`
6. `excute` method of `SortTaskCommand` object st is invoked and model is passed in as
an argument.
7. `sortTaskList` method of `Model` is called with `"priority"` being passed as an
argument of the method
8. `execute` method of `SortTaskCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object with
the sorted successfully message as argument to the `LogicManager` object. 

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The proposed filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterPredicate`. It implements `Predicate` with module and tast status conditions, stored as `moduleToCheck` and `statusToCheck`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FilterPredicate#test(Task)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if a task fulfils the given module and/or completion status requirements.
* `FilterPredicate#toString()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns a string representing all the conditions used during the filter operation.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `filter m/CS2103T s/complete` command to filter the task list to show all CS2103T tasks that have been marked complete. The `filter` command calls `Model#UpdateFilteredTaskList`, causing the task list to be filtered with the given conditions for `moduleToCheck` and `statusToCheck`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `moduleToCheck` or `statusToCheck` input is invalid, there will be an error message shown and the address book will continue to show the current `taskFilteredList`.

</div>

Step 3. The user executes `filter m/CS2103T s/imcomplete` command to filter the task list to show all CS2103T tasks that have been marked incomplete. The updated `taskFilterdList` will be filtered based on all the tasks, not only the ones which have been filtered out in the previous filter command from step 2.

Step 4. The user executes `mark 1`. The first task is no longer in `taskFilteredList` since its `statusToCheck` is now complete and no longer fulfils the conditions.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the filter command:

<img src="images/FilterActivityDiagram.png" width="750" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command input format:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Optional condition fields.
    * Pros: Easier to extend and add more conditions.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Compulsory condition fields.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Users have to type unnecessary details in command.

### Mark Task Command

####Command Format

`t mark INDEX` where `INDEX` is the index (shown in the displayed task list) of the task to be marked.

####What is the feature about

The `t mark` command allows users to indicate a specific task is completed.
The task specified will be ticked.

####How does the feature work

The mark task feature is currently implemented through the `MarkTaskCommand` which extends the abstract class `Command`.
A copy of the task to be marked will be created, with its `TaskStatus` set to `COMPLETE`. This marked task will then replace the
original task in the `DistinctTaskList`.

####UML diagrams
Shown below is a sequence diagram of what occurs when the execute method of LogicManager is invoked.

</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the command fails, `Model#replaceTask()` will not be called, so the task list will not change. If so, `MarkCommand` will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the command.
</div>

**Sequence of actions made when `execute` method of `LogicManager` is invoked**

1. The user types the `t mark 1` command.
2. The `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called.
3. The `LogicManager` then calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` which parses `t mark 1`, creating a `MarkCommandParser` object.
4. The `AddressBookParser` calls `MarkCommandParser#parse()` which parses `1` and creates a `MarkCommand` object with an `Index` object storing the target index `1`.
5. Then, the `LogicManager`calls `MarkCommand#execute()`.
6. The `MarkCommand` retrieves the task at the `Index`, which is the first task in the filtered task list, from the `Model`. 
7. The `MarkCommand` command calls `Task#mark()` to create a marked copy of the `taskToMark`.
8. This `markedTask` has all fields similar to the original task, except its `TaskStatus` is `COMPLETE`.
9. Then, `MarkCommand` calls `Model#replaceTask()` which replaces the `taskToMark` in the filtered task list in `Model` with the `markedTask`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:The `UnmarkCommand` works the same â€” the only difference is that it calls `Task#unmark()`, which returns a copy of the task with `TaskStatus` set to `INCOMPLETE`.
</div>

### Edit Task Command

####Command Format

`t edit INDEX [m/MODULE]* [d/DESCRIPTION]*` where `INDEX` is the index of the task to edit, and `MODULE` and `DESCRIPTION` are the module and description to replace the current values of the specified task.

####What is the feature about

The `t edit` command allows users to update the specified task with the fields provided. The provided fields will replace the existing fields.

####How does the feature work

The edit task feature is currently implemented through the `EditTaskCommand` which extends the abstract class `Command`.
A copy of the task to be edited will be created, with its existing `MODULE` and `DESCRIPTION` replaced with the new
values provided. This edited task will then replace the
original task in the `DistinctTaskList`.

####UML diagrams
Shown below is a sequence diagram of what occurs when the `execute` method of
`LogicManager` is invoked.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the command is invalid, `Model#replaceTask()` will not be called, so the task list will not change. If so, `EditTaskCommand` will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the command.
</div>

**Sequence of actions made when `execute` method of `LogicManager` is invoked**

1. The user types the `t edit 1 d/task 1` command.
2. The `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called.
3. The `LogicManager` then calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` which parses `t edit 1 d/task 1`, creating an `EditTaskCommandParser` object.
4. The `AddressBookParser` calls `EditTaskCommandParser#parse()` which parses `1 d/task 1` and creates an `EditTaskCommand` object with an `Index` object storing the target index `1` and an `EditTaskDescriptor` object storing the description `task 1` in a `TaskDescription` object.
5. Then, the `LogicManager`calls `EditTaskCommand#execute()`.
6. The `EditTaskCommand` retrieves the task at the `Index`, which is the first task in the filtered task list, from the `Model`.
7. The `EditTaskCommand` command calls `Task#edit()` with the `EditTaskDescriptor` passed as the argument.
8. The `Task#edit()` method checks that the module of the `taskToEdit` is not changed, so it creates a copy of the `taskToMark`, still linked to an exam.
9. This `editedTask` has all fields similar to the original task, except its `TaskDescription` is changed to `Task 1`.
10. Then, the `EditTaskCommand` calls `Model#replaceTask()` which replaces the `taskToEdit` in the filtered task list in `Model` with the `editedTask`.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_
![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)


### \[Proposed\] Add Exam Command

### Add Exam Command

#### How the feature works
The `addExam` command allows users to add an exam to the `DistinctExamList` 
in `AddressBook`, with the following fields of exam module, exam description, 
and exam date.

#### Sequence of the AddExamCommand
**Sequence of actions made when `execute` method of `LogicManager` is invoked**
![AddExamCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddExamCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application. 

Step 2. The user types an `addExam` command. 

Step 3. The command calls `LogicManager#execute()` with 
the command input as the argument, which then calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand() ` 
with command input as the argument. 

Step 4. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` matches the command to be 
a `addExam` command through the command word, which then calls `AddExamCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 5. `AddExamCommandParser#parse()` then parses the command to get `Module`, `ExamDescription` 
and the `ExamDate` objects of the exam by calling their respective `ParserUtil` parse methods. These 
methods will check if the inputted exam description, exam date and module are valid. If it is valid,
the object will be created. Otherwise, exception will be thrown. Then, an `Exam` object is created 
with the three objects as arguments. 

Step 6. `AddExamCommandParser#parse()` returns a new `AddExamCommand` object created with the `Exam`
object created previously as the argument in the constructor. `LogicManager` class will call 
`AddExamCommand#execute()` with a `Model` object as the argument. 

Step 7. `AddExamCommand#execute()` will check if model already contains the module of the exam 
through `Model#hasModule()`. If it does not contain the module, an exception will be thrown to 
indicate the module is not found. It will also check if the model already contains the exam 
through `Model#hasExam()`. If it contains the exam, an exception will be thrown 
to indicate that the exam has already been added.

Otherwise, it will call `ModelManager#addExam()` with the exam as the argument, 
which calls `AddressBook#addExam()` that will add the exam to the `DistinctExamList`, 
which stores all the exams.`AddExamCommand#execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` 
object to display that the exam was successfully added.
